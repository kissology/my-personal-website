    <h2 id="About Me">About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Caitlin Ma and I am a queer AAPI actor/performer based in Brooklyn, NY. Born and raised in Los Angeles, I attended Los Angeles County Highschool for the Arts, which then lead me to getting my B.F.A in Acting from S.U.N.Y Purchase. For the past 10 years I have been working as an actor and performer, as well as a beverage director for prominent cocktail bars all over the city. I am also an avid cyclist, trivia enthusiast, and enjoy cooking, tarot and all things occult. Interest in underground has also lead me to discover a passion and love for the art of drag, where I make and construct costumes and wigs for myself and other NYC based performers. I am brand new to coding! I hope to bring my artistic background to font end developement.

    <h2 id="Upcoming Rides">Upcoming Rides</h2>
    <p>On Nov 6th, I will be doing an annual ride from Brooklyn to Brewster, New York! The 70 Mile ride from Grand Army Plaza will take the Hudson River Greenway starting at Van Corlandt Park. The greenway was once an old railtrail that has been paved over to providing paved bike paths all throughout upstate new york, some going all the way to Canada! One day I hope to do a bike camping trip from NYC to Montreal.

    <h2 id="Tarot">Catland vs Enchantments</h2>
    <p>Aside from your typical Santeria that can be found in East Harlem and other latin american neighborhoods within the five buroughs, more broadly stocked occult shops are hard to come by. There are two major ones in New York; Enchantments in the East Village and Catland in Bushwick. While Catland offers more of a library of certain occult writings and local zines on witchcraft, Enchantment's offers custom candles, carved and specially taylored to your candle magic needs.
